## Description
This application is a functional note taking application that uses an Express.JS back end. It is deployed using heroku to allow the live back end and front end to work simultaneously. The back end includes a database file that is json format where the data is pushed to, read, and pulled from, as per CRUD API methodolgy. The back end utilises Express.JS features such as router modularisation and get/post calls. The front end includes inputs to create a title of a note, the contents of a note, and a collum to the left where saved notes are stored.
